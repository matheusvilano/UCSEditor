# UCSEditor

## Motivation

A sound designer friend once told me he uses a convention called [Universal Category System](https://universalcategorysystem.com/) (UCS) to organize his sound libraries - and he then proceeded to complain about the lack of UCS-compliant sound library management tools. Funny fact: I originally designed and coded this application as a playful birthday gift to him, but it turned out to be quite robust - so I figured I should share it online!

## Summary

UCSEditor is, at its core, a cross-platform Xamarin Forms application that revolves around a data grid where each row represents an audio file. The application allows basic operations such as renaming files, adding user data, and playing sounds. Currently, Windows and macOS are both supported. Builds for iOS and Android are possible, although currently not officially supported.

## Building from Source

Use either Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio 2022. Confirm that target platform/build (Windows, Release) was selected automatically. Finally, build!
